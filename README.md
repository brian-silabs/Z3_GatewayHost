## Build Instructions 
You will need to add 2 files to Silicon Labs' SDK to build the project
The 2 rijndael*.c files are open source files to be downloaded (those are not Silabs copyright, hence not included in SDK purposefully) and copied to the respective folder â€¦./ developer/sdks/gecko_sdk_suite/v2.6/platform/base/hal/micro/generic/aes.

Also, 2 Libraries are necessary :
* libncurses
* libreadline

# On Windows 
Simplest way is by using Cygwin
WSL can be used too if you find the dependencies packages and have a working tty to COM link

# On Other platforms (Linux & Darwin) 
Simply run *make -j4 all*

## Run Instructions
Run using *./Z3_GatewayHost -n 0 -p COM14*
