# Z3 GatewayHost

## Description
Zigbee 3.0 Gateway Host implementation. Connects to an EZSP NCP target
This project implements most of HA profiles a Gateway must on Endpoint 1
It also acts as a Green Power Combo, hence can handle Green Power Devices on its network

## Build Instructions 
You will need to add 2 files to Silicon Labs' SDK to build the project
The 2 rijndael*.c files are open source files to be downloaded (those are not Silabs copyright, hence not included in SDK purposefully) and copied to the respective folder â€¦./ developer/sdks/gecko_sdk_suite/v2.6/platform/base/hal/micro/generic/aes.

Also, 2 Libraries are necessary :
* libncurses
* libreadline

# On Windows 
Simplest way is by using Cygwin
WSL can be used too if you find the dependencies packages and have a working tty to COM link

Fix an issue in the SDK that causes:
```console
FATAL: Could not set pipe reader to non-blocking (22): Invalid argument
Z3_GatewayHost: ../../../../../SiliconLabs/SimplicityStudio/v4/developer/sdks/gecko_sdk_suite/v2.7/protocol/zigbee/app/util/serial/linux-serial.c:406: setNonBlockingFD: Assertion `false' failed.
Aborted (core dumped)
```

Edit gecko_sdk_suite/v2.7/protocol/zigbee/app/util/serial/linux-serial.c:406 to:
```c
int status = fcntl(fd, F_SETFL, flags | O_NONBLOCK);
```
# On Other platforms (Linux & Darwin) 
Simply run *make -j4 all*

## Run Instructions
Run using *./Z3_GatewayHost -n 0 -p COM14*
